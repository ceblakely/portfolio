      <h2>CUUP Website Rebrand</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>
          CUUP has been facing negative reviews about product quality and the
          return/exchange process that are adversely impacting sales. The rise
          and fall of Instagram fashion’s reputation has also left consumers
          feeling dubious about the specialized fit CUUP claims to offer.
          Additionally, the existing website does not adequately reflect the
          aesthetic that the brand promotes on Instagram. This branding
          discrepancy is detrimental to CUUP’s ability to attract new customers
          and create brand loyalty amongst existing customers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          Our objective was to rebrand the website to enhance CUUP’s credibility
          by providing information on how their bras are designed to fit a
          variety of body types and education for consumers that aim to
          understand how sizing works prior to purchasing. Also, the new website
          will address concerns with customer service by providing the
          return/exchange policies and what that process looks like.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Increase digital sales by 5% over the next quarter.</li>
          <li>
            Increase average time on website by 10% over the next quarter.

      <h4>Brand History</h4>
      <p>
        CUUP is a direct to consumer startup focused on providing the essential
        bra for women. The company's vision is to have a collection of
        flattering, comfortable, and unrestrictive bras built for all women that
        don’t compromise comfort, fit, or aesthetic. Founded by Kearnon O'Molony
        and Abby Morgan, CUUP is headquartered in New York

      <h4>Relevant Facts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>CUUP offers cup sizes from A to H and band sizes from 30 to 38.</li>
        <li>Offers virtual bra fittings by appointment</li>
        <li>
          Free returns on all U.S. orders of unworn and undamaged full
          priced-bras and swimwear within 30 days of receiving
        </li>
        <li>
          They are supply-side integrated, meaning one of the lead investors
          owns the factories, which is why CUUP is able to make 35 sizes versus
          the 17. Most companies do about 12-17 fittings.

    <h2>User Experience Research</h2>
    <div class='standard' id="targetAudience">
      <h4>Target Audience</h4>
      <p>
        CUUP's target audience primarily include people that want to enhance
        their confidence and femininity by investing in understated, but
        stylish, undergarments.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a number of barriers that potential customers in our target
        audience could be facing that is preventing brand engagement:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The media channels CUUP advertises in are not reaching our target
          customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our target customers do not know what differentiates CUUP from any
          other bra.
        </li>
        <li>
          The target customer would prefer to go to a store and try on a bra to
          ensure the correct size is purchased.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <div id="empathyMaps">
      <h4>Aggregated Empathy Map</h4>
      <p>
        Since our target audience is quite large, I decided to create an empathy
        map to get a general overview of what a typical user's feelings, pain
        points, and experience could look like while navigating CUUP's website.

    <h2>Interface Design</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        It was important for this website redesign to not appear like too
        drastic of a change for CUUP's brand. Their existing website's color
        palette is black and white, with the exception of the color in the
        images. This minimalist color palette makes sense for a bra company that
        focuses on the only the essential features that make for a supportive
        bra, but I found that adding a warmer shade of white allowed for the
        Spring & Summer Collection product images to pop more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chosen fonts for this website redesign were Inter for the headings
        and Habibi for the paragraphs, links, and buttons. Habibi is highly
        elegant and classic serif font that reflects CUUP's commitment to an
        understated and quality product. Inder complements Habibi by being
        highly legible and designed for the online reader.

        Prior to starting to design the interface, I narrowed down the key elements the interface needed to include in order to reach the project objectives.
