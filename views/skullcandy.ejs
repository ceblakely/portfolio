      <h2>Skullcandy Website Rebrand</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>
            While Skullcandy’s <a href='skullcandy.com'>current website</a> has well-designed graphics with an engaging use of color, it lacks a design that speaks to the outdoor actions sports demographic that is considered to be their target audience. This inconsistent messaging is hindering Skullcandy’s ability to create a memorable brand that the target audience chooses when shopping for new audio products.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>
            The goal of this website redesign was to infuse more of the brand’s history into its product promotion. The story of Skullcandy’s inception should be used to connect with the target audience and show how the products are designed specifically for them. The following are metrics that will be used to determine the success of this website redesign
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Increase in online sales.</li>
          <li>
            Increase in average time on website.
          </li>
          <li>Increase in repeat visits.</li>

      <h4>Brand History</h4>
      <p>
        Skullcandy Inc. is an American company based in Park City, Utah, that markets headphones, earphones, hands-free devices, audio backpacks, MP3 players, and other products.  In 2001, Rick Alden, a former snowboarder, was frustrated at having to unplug his earphones from his tunes to use his phone. His solution was called Link--headphones and technology that paired the two devices. It was Skullcandy's first product. Skullcandy was later founded by Rick Alden and Cris Williams in 2003. Skullcandy was acquired by Mill Road Capital for $196.9 million at $6.35 per share. The deal was finalized and completed on October 3, 2016, and the company became a private business again.

        There are a number of barriers that potential customers in our target
        audience could be facing that is preventing brand engagement:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The media channels CUUP advertises in are not reaching our target
          customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our target customers do not know what differentiates CUUP from any
          other bra.
        </li>
        <li>
          The target customer would prefer to go to a store and try on a bra to
          ensure the correct size is purchased.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>User Personas</h4>
      <p>The following user personas go into detail about CUUP's target audience. From this information, I am able to design an interface based on the lifestyle, needs, expectations, and pain points that the target audience experiences.</p>

    <h2>Interface Design</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        It was important for this website redesign to not appear like too
        drastic of a change for CUUP's brand. Their existing website's color
        palette is black and white, with the exception of the color in the
        images. This minimalist color palette makes sense for a bra company that
        focuses on the only the essential features that make for a supportive
        bra, but I found that adding a warmer shade of white allowed for the
        Spring & Summer Collection product images to pop more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chosen fonts for this website redesign were Inter for the headings
        and Habibi for the paragraphs, links, and buttons. Habibi is highly
        elegant and classic serif font that reflects CUUP's commitment to an
        understated and quality product. Inder complements Habibi by being
        highly legible and designed for the online reader.
